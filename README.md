This is my final year project - BLOCKCHAIN BASED COPYRIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project was finished on 'April 2024' but i'm uploading it on 'July 2024'.
To give a brief intro of this project i'm adding part of my blackbook :
-------------------- 
In today's digital landscape, safeguarding intellectual property rights has emerged as a critical 
priority for creators and content proprietors. With the proliferation of digital content and the 
persistent threat of piracy, traditional copyright detection mechanisms often find it challenging to 
keep pace. Recognizing this need, our project introduces a pioneering solution: a Blockchain
based Copyright Detection System poised to tackle these issues head-on. 
The proposed Blockchain-based Copyright Detection System harnesses the fundamental 
characteristics of blockchain technology, capitalizing on decentralization, transparency, 
immutability, and cryptographic security to establish a trustless and efficient copyright detection 
ecosystem. At its core, Blockchain-based Copyright Detection System relies on a decentralized 
ledger, smart contracts, and decentralized storage to provide a seamless and tamper-resistant 
platform for the registration, monitoring, and enforcement of copyright ownership. 
By leveraging blockchain's decentralized ledger, Blockchain-based Copyright Detection System 
eliminates the need for a central authority, mitigating the risk of data manipulation or 
unauthorized alterations. Every transaction, from copyright registration to content usage, is 
recorded transparently and immutably on the blockchain, ensuring an irrefutable trail of 
ownership. Smart contracts, autonomously executing predefined terms and conditions, facilitate 
automated copyright management, streamlining processes and reducing reliance on 
intermediaries. 
Decentralized storage further fortifies Blockchain-based Copyright Detection System by 
distributing copyrighted content across a network of nodes, making it resistant to single points of 
failure and enhancing data security. Through cryptographic techniques, Blockchain-based 

Copyright Detection System ensures that content remains encrypted and accessible only to 
authorized parties, safeguarding against unauthorized reproduction or distribution. 
Moreover, Blockchain-based Copyright Detection System offers an inclusive ecosystem that 
empowers creators of all scales, from independent artists to large enterprises, to assert and 
protect their intellectual property rights. By providing a user-friendly interface and seamless 
integration with existing copyright enforcement frameworks, Blockchain-based Copyright 
Detection System enhances accessibility and adoption while fostering a culture of compliance 
and respect for intellectual property. 
In essence, the Blockchain-based Copyright Detection System represents a transformative leap 
forward in the realm of copyright protection, offering a robust, transparent, and immutable 
solution tailored to meet the evolving demands of the digital age. With Blockchain-based 
Copyright Detection System, creators and content owners can confidently navigate the digital 
landscape, secure in the knowledge that their intellectual property rights are safeguarded with 
unparalleled efficiency and integrity.
